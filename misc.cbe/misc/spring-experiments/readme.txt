these are my experiments to build a working mainline dts for the spring chromebook
based on the mainline u-boot dts and the legacy (chromeos) dts - the folders are:

- experiments - my experiments, not working yet, increasing numners = progress
- u-boot - relevant dts files from mainline u-boot v2021.04
- chromeos - relevant dts files from chromeos linue kernel tree release-R91-13904.B-chromeos-3.8

status:

- u-boot - has working display (but does not detect any usb devices)
- mainline - display not working, sound not working
